The Clowder system, which was designed to manage test machines, has been improved by addressing the issues of system management and accessibility. It was required to have a flexible user interface for dynamic accessibility, and a functional database system for storage and management. These issues have been resolved by designing a front-end and extending the back-end  software that provides the required functionality on the user interface and the database. We have extended a web interface where users can communicate with the test machines by sending requests via the HTTP protocol. This web interface contains the required functionality for making reservations, updating machine details and viewing the inventory and has generally resolve the issue of user accessibility. Also, as part of the requirement to complete the Clowder system, we extended a SQL database for storing and retrieving data. This database enables the Clowder system to store and manage data of users  activity on the test machines and their information. The database we have created has the ability to plug in a DHCP server which between the Clowder and the test machines. All these components has accomplished the requirement for this project and now made it easier for researchers to use the Clowder system without much complexity.
