Clowder is a system designed to help researchers in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science to manage and control clusters of test machines. Some of the features that required improvement in this system were the ability to reserve a machine for a certain period of time, a function that allows users to add more computers and manage their properties, and a user interface where users can have interactive access to the system. Therefore, there was a need to upgrade and complete this system by developing software that provides the  missing functionality. A web interface improves the user accessibility. Having a dynamic database system provides the functionality of keeping record of user activities, storing computer information and managing all reservations. These design approach were achieved using SQL models, HTML templates and the Go programming language. Instead of performing several command line prompt statements, which is the current method in the use of Clowder system, the software provides flexible user access to the cluster of computers, a dynamic system management in a single software system as a research tool in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.
