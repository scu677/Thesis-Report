\textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}

Clowder is a system designed to help researchers in the Faculty of Engineering and Science to manage and control clusters of test machines. Some of the features that were missing in this system is the ability to reserve a computer for a certain period of time, a function that allows users to add more computers and manage their properties , and also a user interface where users can have interactive access to the system. Therefore, there was a need to upgrade and complete this system by developing software that provides the  missing functionality. A web interface addresses the issue of user accessibility. Having a dynamic database system provides the functionality of keeping record of user activities, storing computer information and managing all reservations. These design approaches are achieved using SQL models, HTML templates and the Go programming language. Instead of performing several command line prompt statements, which is the current method in the use of Clowder system, the software provides flexible user access to the cluster of computers, a dynamic system management in a single software system as a research tool in the Faculty of Engineering and Science.
