\section{Test cases}
We have evaluated this software by testing different functionalities as specified by the requirements. This was achieved by creating multiple cases that demonstrates the performance of the software. 
\section*{Checking Available Machines}
In the software specification section \ref{searchinventory}, it is required to have a search options on the user interface. One of this search requirement is to check for available machines (unreserved machines). \autoref{randreserve1} is a list of machines reserved for different dates. The test is to enter a search query with a specific date interval and ask the software to provide any machine available within that date. We have randomly generated different machines and reservations to show an evaluation of the reservation process. \autoref{mandr} shows a scatter plot demonstrating test coverage. So after the random generation of different reservations on different machines, we used a set of 5 machines with 10 reservations to evaluate another test case as shown in \autoref{randreserve}. Here we can see the search result obtained from seven set of date searched for on this random data.

\section*{Reserving a machine}
Reserving a machine is another requirement in section \ref{makereserve}. This is the process where users choose and reserve a machine for a definite time and date. When a reservation is made, the details of the reservation appear under the machine being reserved. \autoref{reserve} shows the evaluating process of this function, where we reserved a machine by selecting a user name, machine and inserting start and end time/date. After submitting with the reserve button, it appears on the inventory with other reservations. During testing we tried to input a wrong date and time format and we got an error as shown in \autoref{error}. This demonstrates that the software will not take an invalid date format for a reservation rather it will issue a warning to the users appropriately.

\section*{Updating a machine}
Update functionality, as in section \ref{addmachines}, allows users to change the details of a machine already stored in the database. This is to enable them to update the information whenever there is an upgrade in the system. We have tested this functionality by changing the details of a machine listed in the inventory. \autoref{update2} shows the process of updating the inventory. This process has demonstrate that this function performed as required because data was collected accordingly and stored without any error.

\section*{Filtering inventory}
This functionality helps the user to filter the inventory using the context of desired information. For example, the user is able to filter the machines inventory with memory size or reservation dates. The size range is inserted in the search to get the list of machines that fall within the range. When the button is clicked, the  server returns the list of machine that falls in the range. Another type of filtering is the the drop list filter. This type has a drop down menu user select a context option to search for. For example, user can filter the machine inventory by selecting a kind of microarchitecture.

\section{Performance Evaluation}
We have evaluated the performance of this software by comparing the performance of the functionality with different sizes of data. The reason for this process is to observe how the software will perform as the system grows in number of machines. For each requirement tested we recorded their network request speed and the  layout speed. We used random generated data to increase the size of machines from 10 to 1000, and performed this same evaluation accordingly. \autoref{available} shows the performance of the software where we compared the event of searching for a machine in the system. The graph points progress partially linear as the data increased. \autoref{addmachine} and \autoref{addreservation} as well shows same progression, and that means that the performance is steady with a slight change in speed as the system data increases.
